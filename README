This is a basic tool to convert SF.net bugs to a JIRA repository.

For now, there only is a basic SF.net export reader. It works around some
encoding quirks (seriously - creating htmlentities from utf-8 you are
interpreting as windows-1252. wtf.).

The initial plan is to use SOAP to push the bugs to the JIRA install. Maybe
another method will be used later on, depending on what works best.



This entire project is MIT-licensed. Feel free to use it for whatever you like,
but bugfixes & patches are, of course, very welcome. Then again, there are no
bugs in my code! ;-)
