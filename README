This is a basic tool to convert SF.net bugs to a JIRA repository.

For now, there only is a basic SF.net export reader. It works around some
encoding quirks (seriously - creating htmlentities from utf-8 you are
interpreting as windows-1252. wtf.).

The initial plan is to use CSV to get the bugs to the JIRA install. Maybe
another method will be used later on, depending on what works best.


The first stage of conversion is determining the bug tracker ids (to create backlinks to the original bugs) and to determine the max number of comments/attachments (to create the right number of columns). This is done by calling

prepare.py <export.xml> <config.py>

The second stage creates dummy issues to create usernames in JIRA. This project can then be deleted. An example import configuration is part of the project (this can be used in the JIRA import screen).

create_user.py <config.py> <create_user.csv>

This entire project is MIT-licensed. Feel free to use it for whatever you like,
but bugfixes & patches are, of course, very welcome. Then again, there are no
bugs in my code! ;-)
